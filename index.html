            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ruike Lin.

                Iâ€™m an international student majoring in Information Science with a strong focus on Human-Computer Interaction. 
                I have experience working as an undergraduate assistant, where I contributed to research and projects related to my field of study.
                
                This is my fourth year in Wisconsin, and I have spent the past two years in Madison.
                
                Outside of my studies, I am a passionate dog lover and have two dogs. On weekends, I often take them to a nearby park, 
                where we enjoy walks and outdoor activities together.</p>
